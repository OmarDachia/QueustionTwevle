What is Gross Pay?
Gross pay is the amount of money earned per paycheck before deductions are made. Typically, the gross pay amount includes an employeeâ€™s standard pay rate or salary, plus any overtime during a pay period.

Whether an employer pays weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, the definition of gross pay remains the same. The amount of compensation that an employee receives on each check may change.
